=========================
IGTextViewWithBackTab
=========================

It's simple: an NSTextView subclass that adds an IBOutlet/property NSView \*backTabTarget and overrides insertBacktab: to make backTabTarget the first responder.  (Based on an idea from http://www.hopelessgeek.com/2005/11/17/nstextview-shift-tab-to-lose-focus, by Adam Knight.)
